# 3rd Company Diary

We were still reeling from the Cataclysm, learning to cope with the absence of mana. Some of our arcanists have even died from mana starvation. And at night, the attack came! Huge creatures, insects, coming out of the ground, grabbing victims and vanishing again…
 One of the refugees, a dwarf, said the creatures were redeemers, and one of my sub-officers confirmed this. Somehow, those monstrosities had found our valley and were stalking us! Only solid stone protects us from their surprise assaults. 
 Our foraging parties are ambushed daily and we keep losing troops. And yet, without foraging, we will starve. 
 …
 This is my last entry. One huge redeemer managed to dig through the stone, and they are pouring into our fortifications! I shall take up my sword and die alongside my legionaries! Long live the Empire!
