Spell/&MirrorImageDescription=Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, each time a creature targets you with an attack, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.\nIf you have 3 duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With 2 duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With 1 duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.\nA duplicate's armor class is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it is Blinded, or has Blindsight, Truesight or Tremorsense (doesn't apply if you don't touch ground).

Spell/&SpellWebDescription=You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area. Each creature that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs can use its actions to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
