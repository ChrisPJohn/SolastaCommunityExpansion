# Solasta Community Expansion

This is a collection of work from the Solasta modding community. It includes feats, subclasses, items, crafting recipes, gameplay options, UI improvements, and more. The general philosophy is everything is optional to enable, so you can install the mod and then enable the pieces you want. There are some minor bug fixes that are enabled by default.

The goal with the modifications provided here is to minimize code patches. Minimizing code patches means compatibility with other mods is easier as well as makes maintenance easier. Any code patches should be as targeted and minimal as possible to reduce the chance of unintended side effects. There are a lot of interesting things that can be done with just edits to the database.

# How to contribute

Do you have a mod you want to see included here? We are happy to take new contributions! The best way to get involved is to:

1. Make a branch off of the `Dev` branch, name it something related to the changes you are making.
2. Commit your edits to your branch.
3. Make sure to test your changes. This is a good opportunity to take screen shots so you can show off the changes.
4. Make a pull request to merge your branch into `Dev`. You can help this process by sharing screen shots to show off the change as well as including an english description of what the change does.
5. Wait for a review. We try to stay on top of this, but it's a hobby. If you haven't heard anything in 3 days you can message ChrisJohnDigital#9182 on Discord or email chris@chrisjohn.digital.
6. Once the review is done, the changes will get merged in to the `Dev` branch. The `Dev` branch will periodically be tested and merged in to `master` to build releases.
