# Solasta Unfinished Business

This is a [collection of work](https://github.com/SolastaMods/SolastaUnfinishedBusiness/wiki) from the Solasta modding community. It includes multiclass, feats, classes, subclasses, items, crafting recipes, gameplay options, UI improvements, and more. The general philosophy is everything is optional to enable, so you can install the mod and then enable the pieces you want. There are some minor bug fixes that are enabled by default.

# How to contribute

Do you have a mod you want to see included here? We are happy to take new contributions! The best way to get involved is to:

1. Make a branch off of the `Dev` branch, name it something related to the changes you are making.
2. Commit your edits to your branch.
3. Make sure to test your changes. This is a good opportunity to take screen shots so you can show off the changes.
4. Make a pull request to merge your branch into `Dev`. You can help this process by sharing screen shots to show off the change as well as including an english description of what the change does.
5. Wait for a review. We try to stay on top of this, but it's a hobby.
6. Once the review is done, the changes will get merged in to the `Dev` branch. The `Dev` branch will periodically be tested and merged in to `master` to build releases.

# How to compile

    - [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
    - [.NET x64 6.00.300 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks)
1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager (UMM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21)

3. Create the environment variable *SolastaInstallDir* and point it to your Solasta game home folder
    - tip: search for "edit the system environment variables" on windows search bar
