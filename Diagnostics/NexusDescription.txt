This is a collection of work from the Solasta modding community. It includes multiclass, races, classes, subclasses, feats, fighting styles, spells, items, crafting recipes, gameplay options, UI improvements, Dungeon Maker improvements and more. The general philosophy is everything is optional to enable, so you can install the mod and then enable the pieces you want. There are some minor bug fixes that are enabled by default.

[*][b]Resonating Strike[/b]: Select one creature within melee range of you and a different creature that you can see within 5 feet of main target. You make a melee attack with current weapon against first creature. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and resonating sound leaps to second target, dealing thunder damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
At 5th level, the melee attack deals extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the thunder damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th and 17th levels.
[*][b]Sound Burst[/b]: Create a burst of thundering sound, forcing creatures adjacent to you to make a Constituion saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage.
This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
[*][b]Sunlit Blade[/b]: Make a melee attack with a weapon. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and is enveloped in glowing radiant energy, shedding dim light for the turn. Next attack against this creature while it is highlighted is done with advantage.
At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. The damage increases by another 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.
[*][b]Find Familiar[/b]: You gain the service of a familiar.
[*][b]Mule[/b]: The recipient of this spell is able to ignore the effects of heavy loads or armor on movement speed. They can also carry slightly more weight.
[*][b]Pact Mark[/b]: You place a mark form your pact onto a creature you can see within 90ft. It becomes vulnerable to you and takes an additional 1d6 damage whenever you hit it with a weapon or spell attack. This damage is the same type as the attack that hits.
[*][b]Radiant Motes[/b]: Unleashes a swarm of 5 radiant projectiles that deal 2 radiant damage each, but never miss. Targets may radiate light for up to 1 minute.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates 2 more projectiles for each slot above 1st.
[*][b]Petal Storm[/b]: Choose an unoccupied 15-foot cube of air that you can see within range. An elemental force of swirling winds appears in the cube and lasts for the spell's duration. The cloud heavily obscures its area. Any creature that enters the storm for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d4 slashing damage. As a bonus action, you can move the storm up to 30 feet in any direction.
[*][b]Protect Threshold[/b]: Tracing arcane sigils along its boundary, you can ward a doorway, window, or other portal from entry. For the duration, an invisible eldritch creature stalks the warded portal. Any creature that attempts to pass through the portal must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d6 psychic damage, or half as much on a successful save.
[*][b]Earth Tremor[/b]: You strike the ground and unleash a tremor of seismic force, hurling up earth, rock, and sand.
[*][b]Winter's Breath[/b]: Create a blast of cold wind to chill your enemies and knock them prone.
[*][b]Frenzy[/b]: With a gesture, you reduce a crowd to base instinct and violence. Choose a point you can see within range. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is frenzied for the duration. When a creature is frenzied, it draws a melee weapon, if it has one. A frenzied creature must use its action at the beginning of its turn to attack a creature within its reach. It uses a melee weapon, if it has one, or an improvised weapon or unarmed strike, if it doesn't. If multiple targets are within the creature's reach, it chooses its target randomly. If there is no target within the creature's reach, it attacks itself, against its own AC, dealing damage as normal on a hit. At the end of its turn, a frenzied creature can repeat its saving throw, ending the effect on it early on a success.
[*][b]Reverse Gravity[/b]: This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range.
[*][b]Mind Blank[/b]: Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition.
[*][b]Foresight[/b]: You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target can't be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.
[*][b]Mass Heal[/b]: A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore 120 hit points each to 6 creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. 
[*][b]Meteor Swarm [Single Target][/b]: Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at a single point you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on the point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.
[*][b]Power Word Heal[/b]: A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
[*][b]Power Word Kill[/b]: You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.
[*][b]Shapechange[/b]: You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower.
[*][b]Time Stop[/b]: You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.
[*][b]Weird[/b]: Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
