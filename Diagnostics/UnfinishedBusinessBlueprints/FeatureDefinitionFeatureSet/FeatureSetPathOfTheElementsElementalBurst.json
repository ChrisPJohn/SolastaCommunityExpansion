    "description": "Starting at 10th level, you gain additional powers depending on the elemental calamity chosen at 3rd level.\n• <b>Storm</b>: While you are raging, you can target a 3x3 area within 60 feet and use your bonus action to call a bolt of lightning. On a failed Dexterity saving throw, each enemy creature within that area receives 3d10 lightning damage and becomes unable to use reactions for 1 round (save for half damage, save to prevent reaction loss). You can use this feature once per short rest. The damage increases to 4d10 at 15th level, and 5d10 at 20th level.\n• <b>Blizzard</b>: While you are raging, you can target a 3x3 area within 60 feet and use your bonus action to send a gust of freezing wind. On a failed Strength saving throw, each enemy creature within that area receives 3d8 cold damage and becomes prone (save for half damage, save to prevent becoming prone). You can use this feature once per short rest. The damage increases to 4d8 at 15th level, and 5d8 at 20th level.\n• <b>Wildfire</b>: While you are raging, you can target a 3x3 area within 60 feet and use your bonus action to hurl waves of intense heat. On a failed Dexterity saving throw, each enemy creature within that area receives 4d6 fire damage and becomes ignited (save for half damage, save to prevent being on fire). You can use this feature once per short rest. The damage increases to 5d6 at 15th level, and 6d6 at 20th level.",
