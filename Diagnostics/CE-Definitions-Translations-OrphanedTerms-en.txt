Subclass/&WarlockUrPriestDescription	While the vast majority of divine spellcasters gain their powers from a deity, there are those who despise the gods.

As an Ur-priest, you differ from most warlocks, lacking a patron who grants you your power. Eldritch Invocations you uncover are warped forms of magic the gods might grant their patrons, while Pact Boons are likely divine artefacts you have managed to steal.
